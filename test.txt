Getting Started

In order to log in to Mockr you will need a Github account.  If you don't have
one go to https://github.com/join to create an account.

After you create an account you can sign-in to Mockr using your new Github account.
 Once you have signed in to Mockr you will be able to start creating custom API endpoints
 that the front end of your application can make HTTP requests to and get back correct status
 codes and appropriate response bodies from.

 You have several options to choose from when creating a new route.  The first option is to
 have static response, headers and body data from GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.  The user can specify
 what the response will be when a request is made to each endpoint and for each HTTP verb.

 The second option is to have persistent data enabled for a particular endpoint such that the user is
 able to make requests to the endpoint.  On a POST request the users data will be stored in the database
 and will be able to be retrieved by a GET request.  Put requests will also only update the data without
 over writing it.

 Another feature of persistent data is that the user is able to specify business logic that gets applied
 to incoming requests to the endpoint.  This logic is run in a Node virtual machine along side the
 primary server.
